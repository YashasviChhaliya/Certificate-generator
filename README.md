# Blockchain Course Certificate Generator

## Project Title
Blockchain Course Certificate Generator

## Project Description
This smart contract is designed to generate and manage blockchain-based course certificates. It allows the contract owner to issue certificates to students, ensuring authenticity and immutability. Each certificate contains the student's name, course name, issue date, and verification status.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized and tamper-proof certification system for educational institutions and online courses. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system eliminates fraudulent certificates and provides an easy verification process for employers and institutions.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity systems
- NFT-based certificates for enhanced security
- Smart contract upgrades for multi-course support
- Integration with educational platforms for automated issuance

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Certificate Issuance**: Ensures trust and transparency in certification.
- **Tamper-Proof Verification**: Students and employers can verify certificates on the blockchain.
- **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can issue certificates.
- **Immutability**: Once issued, certificates cannot be altered or removed.
- **Public Accessibility**: Anyone can verify a certificate using the student's wallet address.
